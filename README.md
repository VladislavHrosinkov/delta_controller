This user interface was originally based on Responsive Admin Panel or Dashboard - Flutter UI.

It can be compiled for linux or windows to interface with arduino firmware used to control a delta robot. This firmware is posted in the delta_robot_serial repository, here: https://github.com/VladislavHrosinkov/delta_robot_serial.git

**Compiling a Flutter Program for Linux and Windows**

This README provides instructions on how to compile a Flutter program specifically for Linux and Windows platforms. Generated by AI.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Flutter SDK: Install Flutter by following the official installation guide: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Flutter-compatible IDE: You can use Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have the Flutter and Dart plugins/extensions installed.

### Steps to Compile a Flutter Program for Linux and Windows

1. **Clone the Flutter Project:**
   
   If you have not already done so, clone the Flutter project repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   
   Change your current directory to the root directory of your Flutter project:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   
   Run the following command to install all dependencies specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Compile the Flutter Program:**

   - **For Linux:**
     
     Run the following command to compile the Flutter app for Linux:
     
     ```bash
     flutter build linux
     ```

     This command generates a `build/linux` directory containing the compiled application. You can distribute this directory as needed.

   - **For Windows:**
     
     Run the following command to compile the Flutter app for Windows:
     
     ```bash
     flutter build windows
     ```

     This command generates a `build/windows` directory containing the compiled application. You can distribute this directory as needed.

### Additional Notes

- **Debug vs. Release Mode:**
  
  By default, Flutter runs in debug mode. To build a release version, use:
  
  ```bash
  flutter build <platform> --release
  ```

- **Handling Errors:**
  
  If you encounter any errors during compilation, carefully read the error messages. They usually provide insights into what went wrong. Google, Stack Overflow, and the Flutter community are excellent resources for troubleshooting.

- **Optimizing Performance:**
  
  When compiling for production, consider enabling optimizations to improve performance. This includes minification, obfuscation, and tree shaking. Refer to the official Flutter documentation for more details.

### Conclusion

Following these steps should help you compile your Flutter program successfully for Linux and Windows platforms. If you encounter any difficulties, don't hesitate to consult the Flutter documentation or seek help from the Flutter community. Happy coding!
